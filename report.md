# Brief Report

This is a brief report describing what I learned.  
I learned how to create a GitHub repository, clone it, and use Git commands to manage files.  
I also learned how to build a simple portfolio page using semantic HTML5 elements.  
Creating branches and merging helped me understand version control better.
